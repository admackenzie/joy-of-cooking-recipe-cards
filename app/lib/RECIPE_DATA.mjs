Because this hot pot is so richly flavored, we like to finish the meal by serving tangerines, or another sweet-tart fruit, although this is our own invention, and not traditional.',

To store, put the peppers in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

The only drawback is that it can only be done with one batch per pot of oil. If you do use a thermometer, you will see that the oil initially rises only to the temperature of boiling water. When all the moisture is simmered out of the potatoes, the oil temperature rises and the potatoes brown. Because this recipe does not get up to normal frying temperatures until the very end, you can even use moderate smoke-point fats like extra-virgin olive oil.',

Be sure the layer is on the thin side, no more than 2 inches thick (wider pans will be able to accommodate a larger batch). Add enough oil or melted lard, beef drippings, or duck fat to cover the fries by 1 inch. Bring the potatoes and oil to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium.

				'TEMPEH',
				'Tempeh is a fermented food from Indonesia made from partially cooked beans that have been inoculated with a special mold. As the beans ferment, the mold binds them into a cake and a nutty flavor and firm, meaty texture develops. Soybeans are traditional, and still the most popular bean to use, but tempeh made with other legumes and grains (or a combination of them) is quite common. Though it may not be as versatile as tofu, tempeh is toothsome and has a more assertive, savory flavor—and even the blandest tempeh easily absorbs marinades. These qualities make it a favorite vegetarian protein substitute in many dishes that would normally rely on slices or cubes of meat, poultry, or fish. When crumbled and browned, tempeh is an excellent substitute for ground meat.',
				'Tempeh may be stored refrigerated for up to 10 days in its original packaging or tightly wrapped. If you are able to find unpasteurized tempeh (virtually all commercially available tempeh is pasteurized), its shelf life is very short—about 3 days. Luckily, all tempeh freezes well, for up to 3 months, tightly wrapped. Packages of tempeh should be marked with a freshness date. White mold is to be expected, but  sliminess or signs of darker molds is not desirable, nor is a strong ammonia smell.',
				'Tempeh should be cooked before eating, and is usually cut into slices, strips, and cubes. Crumbled, it makes a fine substitute for ground beef or sausage in dishes like Megan’s Vegan Chili. Since the beans and grains used to make tempeh are only partially cooked before being inoculated,  tempeh is much improved by steaming before marinating and grilling, or using in quick-cooking dishes like stir-fries.',
				'To steam tempeh, leave whole or cut into slices or cubes, as desired. Transfer to a steaming basket, place over rapidly boiling water, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.',

They are sold in dried chunks, slices, flakes, or granules, which will keep for at least a year in a closed container at room temperature. TVP is also rehydrated and used in the formulation of refrigerated and frozen meat-substitute products, often with added seasonings and other ingredients to enhance its texture, such as wheat gluten.',
				'Dried TVP must be cooked with a liquid of some sort, and is quite bland without aggressive seasoning. Granules and flakes swell to twice their volume when cooked, taking on the texture of ground meat. To equal the volume of 1 pound ground meat, soak 1 cup textured vegetable protein; use it alone or in combination with ground meat in meat loaves, spaghetti sauce, chili, tacos, Sloppy Joes, or any other recipe where ground meat is used. A meatloaf made with textured vegetable protein will be softer than one made with meat but will firm up to meat texture if refrigerated overnight.',

				'WHEAT GLUTEN OR SEITAN',
				'First made in sixth-century China, wheat gluten is the oldest plant-based meat substitute, and was adopted by Buddhist monks to bring much-needed protein to their vegetarian diet—though it still lacks lysine, an essential amino acid present in animal proteins, tofu, and tempeh. Also called seitan or wheat meat, the firm protein is made by kneading and washing a dough made of wheat flour to develop the gluten and remove its starch. The most convenient way to make your own seitan is by rehydrating and flavoring vital wheat gluten, a free-flowing wheat gluten powder. Or, purchase seasoned and ready-to-eat seitan products.',
				'Seitan swells, absorbs flavor, and becomes firm with cooking. Small chunks or cutlets can be pan-fried or lightly battered and deep-fried for appealing crispness. Thin slices can be simmered in a sauce and will indeed have the texture of braised meat, but  lengthy cooking brings out a bitter taste. Chop seitan in a food processor or grind in a meat grinder and use it like ground meat in sauces and mixtures like Picadillo. Obviously, wheat gluten should be avoided by anyone with a gluten allergy or sensitivity, especially those with celiac disease.',

				'A classic ingredient in Cassoulet, well-browned confit can also be used in hash, as a topping for a salad of sturdy greens, or added to a bowl of simmered white beans. To make confit without having to add fat, see version II. You can also achieve similar results by seasoning the legs as directed and then braising and browning them as for Braised Carnitas (using the garlic, shallots, zest, and herbs given here).',
				'I. TRADITIONAL METHOD',

The method described in II is more convenient since it does not require this extra step, nor the large amount of fat.

						'(2 strips lemon or orange zest, removed with a vegetable peeler)',
						'2 whole cloves',
						'1 bay leaf',
					],
				},
				'Stir over low heat until the fat melts. Remove from the heat. Slip the duck or goose legs into the fat. They should be completely submerged. If they are not, add more fat. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender, to the point of falling off the bone when prodded with a fork, 2 to 3 hours.',
				'If not using right away, transfer the duck or goose legs to a storage container, then strain the fat over them, making sure they are covered. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to a month. To freeze, gingerly transfer the legs to zip-top bags after they have cooled to room temperature. Add enough fat to completely coat the legs and then seal the bag, forcing as much air out as possible. Freeze for up to 6 months.',
				'When ready to use, warm until the legs are easily removed from the fat. Adjust an oven rack so it is 6 to 8 inches from the heating element. Preheat the broiler. Transfer the legs to a rimmed baking sheet skin side up and broil, turning once, until the skin is crisp and the legs are heated through, 6 to 8 minutes. Alternatively, pan-fry the legs skin side down in a skillet over medium heat, turning once, 5 to 6 minutes or until crisp and heated through. Be careful when turning the meat, as it is very tender.',
				'II. SOUS VIDE METHOD',
				'Cooking the legs sous vide offers two advantages: No extra fat is necessary and, since the salt will not be dispersed in fat, there is no need to dry-brine the legs overnight to season the interior of the meat.',
				'Preheat a water bath to 165°F with an immersion circulator. Season the legs as directed in version I, and add all the ingredients listed except for the fat to a gallon-sized zip-top bag or vacuum bag.

				'For feeding a crowd, you can special order a whole “packer” brisket, which weighs 10 to 15 pounds and serves at least 12. Smoking whole brisket is notoriously difficult to master, and it can take upward of 16 hours to properly barbecue. To be safe, give yourself 20 hours from the time a whole brisket goes on the grate to when guests arrive; if done well ahead of time, wrap tightly in foil, place on a rimmed baking sheet, and keep warm in an oven set to its lowest temperature. Of course, smaller portions cut from the brisket are much more manageable. The easiest to find is the brisket flat, or “first cut,” which runs from 6 to 8 pounds. Unfortunately, the flat is very lean, which is why we recommend finding the marbled point end, or “second cut.” At an average of 3 to 4 pounds, they are relatively small, so you will need 2 or 3 to feed a crowd.

Quickly slide the pizza off the peel onto the baking stone or steel (this move takes practice—consider working on your technique a good excuse to make pizza more often). Bake until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 12 minutes.

				'PIZZA COMBINATIONS',
				'Topping a pizza is a matter of taste. In Russia, pizza may be topped with red herring or mackba (a mixture of sardines, salmon, mackerel, tuna, and onions). Indians top pizza with ginger, minced mutton, and paneer. In Japan, squid and “mayo jaga” (mayonnaise, potato, and bacon) are popular. The “Double Dutch” is a favorite in the Netherlands: double cheese, double onions, and double beef. The important thing to remember is that in order to prevent a soggy pizza, some toppings must be precooked to release their excess fat or liquid. Listed below are a few of our favorite topping combinations.  The amounts given will make two pizzas. For sauce, cheese, and basil amounts, use Pizza Margherita as a guide.',

Lift off and save the scraps for decorations. Cut out and remove the door and windows. While the dough is still warm, you can halve each cut-out piece of window to make shutters.

Repeat with the front and back pieces, icing their side edges and standing them up in the foundation icing next to the sides. Gently press all the iced edges of the house together. If the icing is thick enough, the house should now stand up unaided. If it is wobbly, support it on all 4 sides with jars or cans until the icing dries, 1 hour to overnight, depending on the humidity. Do not attempt to add the roof until the icing is dry and the structure feels solid. Note: Don’t worry if the icing shows, especially along the seam joints, as it will be covered with “icicles” or other decorations.',

Use your fingertip to smooth all the joints where the pieces meet; add extra icing if necessary for stability. If the roof panels droop, support them with jars or cans until the icing sets.

				'This recipe uses several preservation techniques: The peppers are salted and drained overnight, pickled, then partially dried, and “confited” in olive oil. Each step helps reduce the chance of spoilage, first by driving out moisture, then acidifying the peppers, and drying once more. Finally, submerging the peppers in olive oil protects them from oxidizing or growing molds that need air to survive. After all this, the peppers are still not considered shelf-stable by the USDA and must be refrigerated.',
				'So why do it? Though these delectable chiles take multiple days to prepare, once the raw peppers are slit open and seeded, there is very little labor involved. More importantly, you get three wonderful ingredients from one batch of peppers: a briny, chile-infused vinegar (use as you would any hot sauce; it is especially good sprinkled on cooked greens); chile-infused olive oil (perfect for bread dipping or marinating vegetables and cheese); and tangy, moderately spicy chiles (superb for topping pizzas and pasta dishes). Try this procedure once and we are confident you will be doing it every year. As for peppers, we prefer them to be ripe, red, and moderately spicy, though green, yellow, or super-hot chiles will certainly work.',

Cover the crock or vessel to keep out flies, but make sure it can breathe. You may use a square of kitchen towel secured with a rubber band or string, or use specially made fermentation airlocks. If using a crock with a water moat and lid, simply place the lid on top and fill the moat with water.',
				'Check the kraut every couple days. Within a few days, it should start to bubble—this is an indicator that fermentation has begun. Stir or compress the kraut regularly (the carbon dioxide generated during fermentation often pushes the kraut above the brine if it is not heavily weighted). If scum forms on top, simply scrape it off and discard, then press the kraut beneath the brine again. When the bubbling slows, start to taste the kraut (you can taste it before this point, of course, but this is when the kraut becomes noticeably more sour). When you really like how it tastes, it’s done. To store, see here.',

				'DRYING HERBS AND SEEDS',
				'Please read Drying Fruits and Vegetables. Herbs, as a category, are the easiest and most rewarding ingredient to grow. Drying extends the use of annual herb plants so that they may be used year-round. For hardy perennials like rosemary, chives, and bay leaf, drying will enable you to use them in seasonings and spice blends. The seeds, pods, or fruit of some common plants—coriander, mustard seed, juniper, and fennel, to name a few—are relatively easy to harvest from a garden or isolated, unpolluted parts of the countryside.',
				'As with vegetables and fruits, some herbs and seeds dry exceptionally well, and others do not. Generally speaking, resinous and low-moisture herbs dry better. Dried rosemary, bay laurel, and thyme, for instance, retain more of their flavor than dried basil and parsley (let alone cilantro). Outliers, like dill, have an assertive flavor, and their frilly shape dries quickly.',
				'To harvest herbs, see here.',
				'To harvest seeds and pods, wait until they are mature and beginning to dry on the branch, but before they start to burst open (the weather should be sunny). The day before harvesting, hose off the seeds and branches well. At midmorning the next day—when any dew has evaporated, but the temperature is still fairly cool—cut off the branches or stems the seeds are attached to, trimming off any browned leaves and stems.',
				'If you have a dry room with an ambient temperature between 70°F and 90°F, you may loosely tie seeds and low-moisture herbs like rosemary and oregano together into small, well-ventilated bunches. Place each bunch upside down inside a paper bag punctured with air holes, tie the neck of the bag tight with string, and hang the bag, with the leaves or seeds facing down, in a warm, airy place until dry. The bag keeps light from discoloring the leaves and flowers, keeps dust off, and catches any seeds that may drop.  Do not try this with high-moisture herbs like basil, mint, and tarragon, which have a tendency to grow mold during the slow drying time.',
				'As with fruits and vegetables, the most efficient and convenient way to dry large quantities of herbs and seeds is with an electric food dehydrator. Place the sprigs or seeded branches in a loose layer on the drying trays. If the trays have a fine enough mesh to catch the seeds, you may hasten their drying by stripping the seeds off first and spreading them out in a single layer. Set the dehydrator to 95°F for herbs or 105°F for seeds. Leaves should be crisp and ready to crumble; seeds and seed pods should be hard when pressed with a thumbnail.',
				'Small quantities of herbs may also be dehydrated very quickly in a microwave oven.',
				'To dry herbs in a microwave, spread a paper towel on a plate, lay the herb sprigs or leaves in one layer, and place another paper towel on top. Microwave for 1 minute, then rotate and redistribute the herbs on the towel. Microwave them further in 15-second intervals until they are crisp and ready to crumble, turning and redistributing them as you go. We do not recommend oven-drying herbs, as it is difficult to keep the temperature low enough.',
				'To test herbs and spices for dryness, let them cool completely and then transfer to a tightly sealed glass jar. Wait a few hours, then check for condensation. If any appears, dry further. If the herbs or seeds are straight from the garden and you suspect they may harbor insects or their eggs, freeze the sealed jar for 48 hours.',
				'Store dried herbs and spices in tightly closed glass jars in a cool, dark, dry place. Herbs will taste best within 6 months of drying; seeds will last considerably longer. Should they show signs of insect activity, discard them.  Dried herbs and spices retain their flavor best when crumbled or ground just before using. For more on using herbs, see here. To toast and grind spices, see here.',
				'DRYING JERKY',
				'High in protein and lightweight, jerky is the original backpacking food—as well as a satisfying, flavor-packed snack for those on the go. Of course, the convenience and concentrated flavor of jerky comes with a price: You will end up with only one-quarter to one-half (by weight) of the amount of meat you started with. Luckily, the best cuts for jerky making are the leaner, cheaper ones. (Fatty, highly marbled cuts of meat turn rancid much more quickly.)',
				'An electric dehydrator is required for safely making jerky at home. Though not impossible, oven-drying jerky takes up to 3 times as long. Additionally, the oven must be able to maintain a consistent temperature between 145°F and 155°F. If the oven runs too hot, the outside of the jerky will develop a crust and cause case-hardening. If the oven consistently dips below this temperature range, the meat may spoil instead. An instant-read thermometer capable of accurately reading the temperature of thin foods is also an ideal piece of equipment for ensuring safety.',
				'Raw meats can be contaminated with microorganisms that cause disease. There have been several notable outbreaks involving Salmonella and E. coli bacteria in home-dried jerky. Pork and game meats may also harbor Trichinella parasites. In order to reduce the risk of these dangerous organisms, jerky must be brought to an internal temperature of 160°F (or 165°F for poultry), but it is important to do it in such a way as to prevent case-hardening.  One of two methods must be used: Simmer meat strips in a marinade for several minutes before placing them on drying racks. Or, after the meat strips have been dried, transfer the strips to a baking sheet and cook them in a 275°F oven for 10 minutes. Which one you choose depends on personal preference. When the strips are heated in a marinade before drying, the result is a more tender jerky. Baking the dried jerky will result in a classic, chewy texture.',

Place it on a plate or baking sheet. You will also need two thick pieces of food-grade plastic that are just smaller in diameter than the mold (disks cut with a jigsaw from a cheap but sturdy plastic cutting board work well) and something heavy to weight them down (such as a can or brick). Line the mold with a 15-inch square of clean flour sack towel. Transfer the curds to the lined mold, spread them evenly, and fold the muslin or cheesecloth over the top so the curds are wrapped. Put one disk on top and weight it down with the can or brick.

				'Pressing cheese',
				'During the next 20 minutes, increase the pressure by gradually adding weight until the total weight being used equals 25 pounds. This can be done by placing a small wooden cutting board on top of the can and placing weight on top of the cutting board (we have even used heavy books, like the cookbook you are holding in your hands, for this application). Then let the cheese rest in the press for 12 hours in a cool place (if possible, transfer to the refrigerator).',
				'Remove the cheese from the press, unfold the muslin, and place the cheese on a rack. Allow to air-dry, unwrapped and on a wooden cutting board, in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 days, or until the surface of the cheese is dry. Turn the cheese a few times a day so both sides can dry out.',
				'This so-called new cheese will be fairly bland in flavor. To age the cheese and allow it to develop its full flavor, when the exterior is absolutely dry, dip it into a thin coat of cheese wax, available from cheesemaking suppliers, to seal off the air and prevent mold. Date the wrapping with a label. Refrigerate on a rack where the temperature drops no lower than 35°F or in the vegetable crisper, where the temperature is about 40°F. Temperatures above 55°F cause the cheese to spoil. Flavor will develop within 1 to 2 months or longer.',

				'COCONUT FLOUR',
				'Coconut flour is high in fiber. Perhaps the most notable thing about coconut flour, other than its mild coconut flavor, is that it is extremely absorbent.

				'CORNMEAL',
				'For information on cornmeal, see About Cornmeal, Hominy, and Grits. Note that when using cornmeal in baking recipes, because it is grainier than flour, it will add a slightly gritty, crumbly texture. For recipes written to use cornmeal, see our recipes for corn breads, Four-Grain Flapjacks, Cornmeal Pancakes, and Cornmeal Waffles.  If a recipe calls for self-rising cornmeal and you want to make your own, add 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder and ½ teaspoon salt to each 1 cup cornmeal.',
				'OAT FLOUR',
				'Oat flour is soft and starchy and can be an excellent addition to gluten-free baked goods, as it bakes up lighter than many other gluten-free flours without a trace of grittiness. Oat flour works especially well in cookies, cakes, and quick breads. For more information on oats, see here.',
				'POTATO FLOUR',
				'Made from whole cooked potatoes that have been dried and ground, potato flour is used chiefly in soups, gravies, breads, and cakes, in combination with other flours, or alone in sponge cakes. Potato flour is different from potato starch. To avoid lumping in cake batters, blend it with the sugar before mixing. In bread recipes, it yields a moist, slow-staling loaf. If using in breads, only add a small proportion of potato flour—about 10 percent of the total amount of flour.  To use as a thickener in sauces and gravies, substitute 1 tablespoon potato flour for 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.',
				'QUINOA FLOUR',
				'A light-yellow flour with a grassy, earthy flavor, quinoa flour is best used with other flours so its flavor doesn’t overpower. For more information about quinoa, see here.',

				'Both nonglutinous (nonwaxy) and glutinous (waxy) rice flours are used extensively across much of Asia. Both of these flours are used in combination with other flours for making gluten-free baked goods. Always buy white rice flour from Asian grocery stores, as some American brands are very gritty and will not yield the best results in baking.',
				'Brown rice flour is grittier than white rice flour but has more flavor and is less gummy. Use it in tandem with white rice flour to get the starchy benefits of the white rice flour and the flavor and heartiness of the brown rice flour. Look for “superfine” brown rice flour.',
				'For more information about rice, see here.',
				'SORGHUM FLOUR',
				'Sorghum flour is gluten-free and ground from the large yellow or white grain of sorghum. Sorghum flour is often used to add flavor and a whole-grain texture in gluten-free baking. It has a subtle flavor somewhat like cornmeal. It is used in combination with other flours in cookies, cakes, and bread, although some bakers report good results when using sorghum flour alone in place of all-purpose flour for pancakes and waffles. For more information about sorghum, see here.',
				'TEFF FLOUR',
				'Teff is the smallest grain, and the flour ground from it is very fine, with a deep brown color and malty flavor. Like most of the flours in this section, teff flour is best combined with other flours in baking due to its lack of gluten and distinctive flavor. For more information about teff, see here.',

While we may think of these milks as modern inventions, almond and walnut milks have long been known in Europe. Some nuts, such as hickory nuts and pecans, were used by North American indigenous peoples to make nut milks. While nut milks are by no means dairy milk’s nutritional equivalent, they are delicious and healthful in their own right, and a boon to those who cannot or choose not to drink milk. For soy milk, see Soy Milk and Tofu. For coconut milk, see here.',
				'Nut and seed milks are easy to make. The only equipment necessary is a blender and something to strain the blended nut or seed and water mixture through. We have used flour sack towels for this purpose, but nut milk bags are the most efficient option (these are easily purchased from online retailers). Once the milk is strained, there will be pulp left behind in the towel or bag. This pulp can be kept refrigerated and used within a week, or spread it out on a baking sheet and dry it in a very low oven. Once fully dry, it can be ground in a food processor to break up any clumps, then stored at room temperature. We use the pulp in baked goods and smoothies or as a replacement for bread crumbs in some recipes.',
				'Nut milks are as perishable as unpasteurized cow’s milk. Refrigerate them and use within a week. Because homemade nut and seed milks do not contain stabilizers, they will separate upon sitting. Simply shake them before use.',

Most salt sold at supermarkets is iodized, and the label will say “iodized.” Do not use iodized salt in pickling or fermentation. The additives in the salt will cloud the brine and may impart undesirable flavors.',
				'SALT SUBSTITUTES',
				'While there is no true substitute for salt, salt substitutes are available on the market. They are chloride salts in which sodium is replaced by calcium, potassium, or ammonia. Because they contain higher levels of other electrolytes in place of the sodium, they should be used only on the advice of a physician. Salt-free seasoning blends, different from a salt substitute, are a tasty alternative to salt and salt substitutes because they are sodium-free and free of the replacement electrolytes. Fresh lemon juice, chopped fresh herbs, and vinegar all make delicious sodium-free enhancements to food as well.',

				'Avoid potato and tomato seeds, which, when sprouting, are poisonous, and fava, lima, and kidney beans, which are extremely toxic raw. Use or buy seeds, preferably organically grown, that have not been chemically pretreated for agricultural purposes. Remove any damaged or moldy seeds.',
				'If you cannot rinse and drain the sprouts at least twice daily, it is beneficial to purchase a sprouting device. Our favorite commercial sprouter is a 1-quart plastic container, engineered to maximize air circulation and regulate moisture. A wide-mouthed 1-quart jar with a mesh cover made from nylon or cheesecloth or commercial screw-on strainer lid is also quite effective.',

				'Too much water is fine because the seeds will absorb only what they can. Soak for 8 to 12 hours. Some seeds sprout better if soaked for less time—for example, hulled sunflower and pumpkin seeds sprout better when soaked for 1 to 2 hours.',
				'Next morning, make sure the lid of the sprouting device is securely closed. If using a jar, cover the top with nylon mesh or cheesecloth attached to the jar by screwing the ring over the cloth or nylon or securing it with a rubber band, or screw on the straining lid. Drain, then rinse thoroughly once or twice with cool water. Drain all the water by shaking and spinning the jar or sprouting device vigorously. If using a jar, shake the seeds to spread over a larger area on the glass and store the jar on its side, propping it up at a slight angle so the screen side is facing down, to allow excess water to drain out while also allowing air circulation. Rinse the sprouts two or three times daily with cool water and drain them thoroughly after every rinse. Keep the sprouts out of direct sunlight, which will “cook” them and cause them to spoil.',
				'Most sprouts develop in 3 to 5 days, and in some cases within 36 hours. Mung beans and soybeans may take up to 8 days. Taste them at every rinse-and-drain session to decide when you most enjoy the flavor. Typically, the smaller they are, the more tender. The sprouts will turn into plants eventually—a lentil, pea, or garbanzo sprout will produce a main stem, in addition to the sprout (taproot) after several more days.',
				'If you wish to remove the hulls, stir the sprouts in a bowl of cold water until the husks rise. Skim them off and drain the sprouts thoroughly. You may serve at once, or leave to drain for a few hours and refrigerate in a zip-top bag or container with a paper towel in the bottom. Some sprouts will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator, but we recommend eating them within 5 days for the best flavor.',
				'SPROUTED MICROGREENS',
				'The main difference between sprouts and microgreens is that microgreens are planted in soil, and the greens are cut at soil level before eating. Certain seeds, such as cress, brown mustard, arugula, flax, and chia form a mucilaginous gel-like sack when they come in contact with water. They cannot be sprouted in the conventional method detailed above.',
				'To grow microgreens, thoroughly moisten a planting medium—anything that can retain moisture is acceptable—soil, vermiculite, fabric, or microgreen-specific medium—and scatter the seeds in a thin layer on top. Keep the medium and seeds moist by watering regularly for 7 to 14 days. When sprouted, leave the sprouts on the germinating surface. Keep them moist and exposed to light until the two small leaves are green and about ⅛ inch long. Harvest by cutting the stems just above the planting medium, rinse, pat dry, and serve. Microgreens are not only delicious, but a beautiful garnish for all kinds of dishes. They store poorly once harvested. They can be refrigerated in a zip-top bag or container when dry to the touch, but they will wilt quickly.',

				'This thick syrup is made of sugar and just enough water to dissolve it and steam any stray crystals from the sides of the pan. It will set up firmly, which allows it to be the glue that holds together a Croquembouche.',

				'Place the pan over medium heat and, without stirring, very gently swirl the pan until a clear syrup forms. It is important that the sugar dissolve and the syrup clarify before it boils, so slide the pan on and off the burner as necessary. Once the sugar is dissolved, increase the heat to high and bring the syrup to a rolling boil. Cover the pan tightly and boil for 2 minutes. Uncover the pan and cook the syrup until it begins to darken. Gently swirl the pan once again, then cook the syrup until it turns a deep amber, or registers about 360°F on a thermometer.',
				'Store the syrup tightly covered at room temperature. The syrup hardens on standing, but if stored in a heatproof jar, it is easily melted by heating the jar gently in hot water.',
				'UNREFINED SUGARS',
				'This category of sugars is a diverse one. Unrefined sugars have a wide range of textures, colors, and flavors. Due to the fact that they are less processed than white or brown sugar, they are more variable. When used in cooking, the cook should consider their unique characters, as they will add their own flavors to any dish they are used in. These sugars are not commonly used in baking, though they may be in some instances. Be aware, however, that unrefined sugars will not behave like refined ones.',
				'Muscovado sugar has a very high molasses content. It is the sugar produced during the final crystallization of sugar from the reduced and concentrated sugarcane syrup (after this final crystallization, the syrup is filtered of waste products and becomes molasses). Muscovado sugar is very dark and flavorful. Use it as you would brown sugar, knowing that it will add its own characteristic flavor.',
				'Turbinado or raw sugar is processed from sugarcane. It is partially refined in a turbine, thus the name, and the crystals have had their molasses coating partially washed off. With coarse, beige crystals, turbinado sugar is closest in character to the yellow or brownish demerara sugar often called for in British recipes. Demerara sugar comes from the first crystallization of cane juice and has a pale golden color and mild, caramel flavor.  Substitute turbinado or demerara sugar cup for cup for granulated sugar, but be aware of their heavier molasses flavor and larger crystal size, which can make them harder to dissolve. These sugars are excellent sprinkled on top of baked goods for crunch and sweetness. We also like to dust the insides of buttered baking pans with these coarse sugars as they melt during baking, providing a darker, caramelized crust.',
				'Piloncillo is an unrefined sugar from Mexico, though this type of unrefined sugar is used all over Central and South America under different names, among them chancaca, rapadura, and panela. It is often sold in dense, light to dark brown cakes or cones, although it may also be found granulated. To use it in cooking, grate it on the large holes of a box grater or chop it into fine pieces with a knife.',
				'Sucanat is dried pure sugar cane juice. The name (a registered trademark) is an abbreviation of sucre de canne naturel or “natural cane sugar.” Sucanat is much lighter by weight than the same volume of granulated sugar, and it has a mild molasses flavor. To substitute Sucanat for 1 cup granulated sugar, use 1 ¼ cups Sucanat and grind it in a spice or coffee grinder before adding to baked goods.',
				'Palm sugar is a coarse brown sugar made from the evaporated sap of different types of palm trees. It is usually sold in pucks or cones much like piloncillo and can be grated or chopped into small pieces for use in cooking. Jaggery is very similar to palm sugar, but it is often made from a combination of palm sap and sugarcane juice. It is commonly used in Indian cooking.',
				'Coconut sugar is a granulated sugar made from the sap of the bud stems of coconut palms. It may be found in puck form, much like jaggery and piloncillo, or granulated. This type of sugar is used across Southeast Asia. Coconut sugar is sometimes called palm sugar, though palm sugar is made from the sap of a variety of palm trees, while coconut sugar is made specifically from coconut palm sap. Coconut sugar, palm sugar, and jaggery are all interchangeable in recipes, though they should not be substituted in recipes calling for granulated sugar.',
				'Maple sugar is made by boiling maple syrup until most of the liquid has evaporated. It has a distinctive, strong, sweet taste. Because of its high cost, it is often reserved for flavoring. It is sold in both block and granulated form. For maple sugar in a block, grate or shave it before combining it with other ingredients.  For using in baked goods, substitute maple sugar for one-third of the total sugar called for in the recipe.',
				'BROWN SUGAR',
				'All brown sugar is made in one of two ways: Raw sugar is dissolved in a syrup, then recrystallized; or refined white sugar is mixed with molasses so the syrup coats the sugar crystals. As a result, brown sugar is a moister cane or beet sugar with a light or dark brown color and more complex flavor than white sugar. As brown sugar hardens and lumps easily, keep it in a tightly covered container or in a tightly closed plastic bag. If the sugar should become hard, place it in a dish, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high in 30-second intervals, using a fork to break up the sugar. Or place in a resealable zip-top bag, add half an apple or a slice of bread to the bag, seal, and let stand. Remove the apple when the sugar softens.  In this book, if neither light nor dark brown sugar is specified, either type can be used. Use dark brown sugar when a stronger flavor or darker color is wanted.',
				'To measure brown sugar, pack it firmly into the measuring cup and level it by pressing with the palm of your hand.  To substitute brown sugar for granulated sugar, use 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar for each 1 cup granulated sugar.',
				'Measuring brown sugar',
				'Pourable granulated brown sugar is also widely available. Depending on the brand, it may not be as sweet, so be sure you know what you are buying and follow the directions on the package when using in recipes.',
				'GRANULATED AND SUPERFINE SUGARS',
				'In this book, when the word “sugar” appears with no qualifiers, it means granulated white sugar—beet sugar or cane sugar, both being 99.5 percent pure sucrose. Granulated sugar can be used for almost every purpose, even for meringue.  One pound of granulated sugar equals approximately 2 cups.',
				'Coarse or decorating sugar is large-crystal granulated sugar and may be clear, white, or tinted colors.',
				'Also called bar or berry sugar, superfine sugar is a finer grind of granulated sugar. It is between granulated sugar and powdered sugar in consistency. Because it dissolves readily, it is used in meringues, for macerating fruits, and in cocktails and other drinks. The crystals are too small for creaming with butter in making cakes, cookies, or in any baking where the sugar crystals must “cut” into the butter. If it becomes lumpy, put the sugar in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush the lumps. Make superfine sugar at home with a food processor, pulsing granulated sugar until fine and powder like.  Superfine sugar can be substituted cup for cup for granulated sugar where appropriate.',
				'To color granulated sugar, sprinkle 1 cup sugar with 10 to 12 drops food coloring and mix well until the sugar is evenly tinted. Pour the sugar onto a rimmed baking sheet and allow it to dry for about 3 hours.',

				'POWDERED SUGAR',
				'Powdered sugar, also called confectioners’ sugar, is a bright white powdery sugar. Its finest form, known as 10X, is the type sold packaged at most markets. In order to lessen clumping, a small quantity of cornstarch is added to the sugar during processing. If it does clump, sift it. Sometimes the cornstarch gives uncooked icings a raw flavor. If desired, before spreading this kind of mixture, you can heat it for about 10 minutes in a double boiler over boiling water. Alternatively, use organic powdered sugar, which is made with tapioca starch instead of cornstarch. Tapioca starch granules, unlike cornstarch granules, absorb moisture and start to swell before being heated. This gives it an advantage in uncooked icings, as it thickens them and makes them smooth and creamy.  Do not try to substitute powdered sugar for granulated in baking—its texture gives a different crumb to cakes. In other uses, substitute 1 ¾ cups powdered sugar for 1 cup granulated sugar.',
				'LUMP SUGAR, SUGAR CUBES, AND PEARL SUGAR',
				'Lump sugar and sugar cubes are granulated sugar molded or cut into rectangles or cubes for use in hot drinks and cocktails. Crystals of Rock Candy make an interesting stand-in for lump sugar and, when separated or crushed, a sparkling garnish for frosted cakes or other desserts.',
				'Pearl sugar is coarse chunks of sugar made by compressing white sugar crystals and sifting them to get a specific particle size. It is used primarily as a topping on baked goods in Western Europe. Belgian pearl sugar is larger than Swedish pearl sugar and is better suited to making Liège waffles, while smaller, hard bits of Swedish pearl sugar are ideal for topping pastries, cakes, cookies, and breads, from France’s chouquettes (small choux pastry puffs topped with pearl sugar before baking) to Scandinavian cakes and pastries.',
				'CHINESE ROCK SUGAR',
				'Made from refined sugarcane juice and used as a sweetener for various Chinese desserts and soups, this sugar is sold in lumps and is available at Asian markets. It is usually crushed or broken into small pieces before use.',
				'SUGAR SUBSTITUTES',
				'Some sugar substitutes can be used in cooking or baking, according to the manufacturer’s directions. However, they do not give the same texture and color in baking as do true sugars and should be used only in recipes especially developed for them. Saccharin is a synthetic sweetener commonly used at the table. It is three hundred times sweeter than sucrose (granulated sugar), but it has a slightly metallic aftertaste. It does not contribute any calories because it is not metabolized in the body. Saccharin should not be cooked, as it becomes bitter when heated. Aspartame is technically considered a nutritive sweetener, contributing 4 calories per gram. However, aspartame is two hundred times sweeter than sugar and very little of it is needed to achieve sweetness. Therefore, its caloric contribution is negligible. Sucralose is a white crystalline powder made from the chlorination of sucrose. It is four hundred to eight hundred times sweeter than granulated sugar. It is stable when subjected to heat, and it can be used in a variety of drinks, baked goods, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Its chemical structure is very close to that of sucrose, but it is noncaloric. Acesulfame potassium is two hundred times sweeter than sugar.',
				'“Natural” sugar substitutes have gained favor in recent years, though they have many of the same drawbacks as the chemically derived sweeteners discussed above. These include stevia, which is made from a South American plant traditionally used to sweeten yerba mate tea. It is sold in powder and liquid form. The liquid form is highly concentrated. Some powdered stevia is formulated to be used as a cup for cup replacement for sugar in baking. While this may technically be true, we find baked goods made with stevia alone to have an off-putting aftertaste. Use stevia for up to half the sugar in baking recipes for the best flavor. Recipes with strong-flavored ingredients like chocolate and peanut butter tend to hide the flavor of stevia best. Use very concentrated forms of stevia, such as liquid stevia, as directed by the manufacturer. Remember that if you use concentrated stevia in a recipe, you will need to compensate for the missing bulk of the sugar by adding egg whites, applesauce, yogurt, or mashed banana. For every 1 cup sugar substituted for in a recipe, add ⅓ cup of one of these bulking agents.',
				'Xylitol is extracted from birch trees and is exactly as sweet as sucrose (sugar). It has a slight cooling effect on the tongue, somewhat like the sensation of chewing a mint leaf. It may be substituted cup for cup for granulated sugar, and it contains 40 percent fewer calories than sugar. It does not have a bitter aftertaste, though ingesting too much xylitol can have a laxative effect.',
				'Monk fruit extract is made from the fruit of a plant related to cucumbers, squash, and melons. It is three hundred times sweeter than sugar and is usually mixed with bulking agents and sold in powder form. It has a bitter aftertaste. For best results, do not substitute more than half the sugar in a recipe with monk fruit extract.',

				'The particulars of the milk you use will determine its consistency. Whole cow’s milk will set up very thick. Low-fat, nonfat, or goat milk will not be as thick. In fact, it might be the consistency of drinkable yogurt. If you prefer thicker yogurt, there are a few things you can do. One is to hold the milk at 180°F for 30 minutes, which will denature some of the whey proteins and cause them to form a thicker gel. Another option is to whisk in ¼ cup dry milk powder for every 1 quart liquid milk before heating it. Finally, you can thicken the yogurt after it has set by ladling it into a colander lined with a flour sack towel and letting it stand until enough whey has drained off for the yogurt to be thickened to your liking.',
				'For this recipe you will need a system for keeping the milk warm as it sets. This can be a small cooler filled with towels. A heating pad or seedling heat mat can be another good option. Insulated containers made specifically for yogurt making are also available, as well as proofing boxes. If you have an immersion circulator, fill a pot or other vessel with water, attach the circulator, and program it to 109°F. When the water is preheated, place the sealed jar of cultured milk in the vessel (the water should completely cover the jar) and let the yogurt set for 5 to 8 hours or until thickened.',

				'Heat the milk over medium heat to 180°F, stirring often. If desired, for a thicker yogurt, hold the milk at this temperature, stirring occasionally, for up to 30 minutes. (The easiest way to do this is by using a double-boiler to prevent the milk from scorching.)',
				'Fill the sink with cold water, set the pan of milk in the water bath, and stir constantly until the temperature reaches 118°F. Be careful at this stage because the temperature will drop rapidly, and if the milk gets too cool, it will not set properly.',
